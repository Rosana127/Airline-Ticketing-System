This system is primarily developed for flight management. The main tasks include establishing a comprehensive flight management system that enables functionalities such as flight addition, search, ticket purchase, ticket refund, and rescheduling. Administrators can quickly locate relevant user information through queries and are able to add, modify, or delete flights while notifying users of any changes. Users, on the other hand, can receive the latest flight information, check their orders, request refunds, and reschedule flights. This system is designed to streamline flight management and improve communication between administrators and users.
